      <description>For the last few months, I have been working on a selection of scripts to make going through carved files even easier, you can find the code here. The process of testing these scripts was to carve files from my stash of drives, run the code and fix any errors and move on to the next drive.
Then I found it, not only a drive I haven’t seen since 2019 but one I thought had died.</description>

      <description>Three years ago, I took an intel stock cooler and hot glued it to an old Western Digital 80GB hard drive and created a piece of art. But what data does it hold? Well with nothing else to do it’s time to break out my Forensics VM and USB Write Blocker and have a snoop around.
Just from what I can remember this drive was at some point used as a boot drive in our Family PC and a PC I used to mess about when trying to use various old IDE drives and random PCI cards.</description>

      <description>Part of the OCR Computer Science A2 is a programming project, which made up a small percentage of the final grade. Our group had a bit of a thing about ducks, I think it’s a deep regret of the teachers telling us about rubber duck decoding and handing us small squeaky ducks. As the start of the project loomed, we had to start brainstorming ideas, my initial idea was a speed limit sign detection AI.</description>
