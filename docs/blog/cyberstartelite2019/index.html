      <h2>CyberStart Elite 2019</h2>
      <p>A vist to SkyGarden, a week in the capital and a SANS FOR500 course!</p>

        <article class="blog_content">
           <p>At the start of the second year of Cyber Discovery, I was invited to carry on with the program, for what I thought was going to be my last year due to my age. The first year was simply amazing with so many interesting, and frustrating, challenges. Somehow, I even managed to make it to CyberStart Elite in the first year (I still do not know how!).</p>

<p>When CyberStart Game began, I saw that a new base had been added, a forensic one; I began work on this straight away, in the library while at sixth-form on an A1342. Trying to balance coursework was tricky (Due to the amount of work that needed to be done, and the duck was sometimes just too appealing to spend an afternoon playing with!) but I managed to squeeze it all in along with Cyber Discovery.</p>

<p>After having completed the forensic base, I moved on to continue with my progress with Headquarters. I finished overall with 98%; Even though this was higher than my completion in the previous year I felt as if it wasn&rsquo;t enough, as many other people had completed all of it. After Game, Essentials rolled out and we were given the chance to re-do the end of module tests, which I started to do, but it soon became apparent that I would not be able to juggle this, revision, BTEC coursework and the duck. I sat down and did all I could, under the illusion that I probably had not done enough to make it to the Elite phase for a second time. Of all the content that was given on Game and Essentials the one that I found the most enjoyable was forensics.</p>

<p>During some Computer Science revision, well listening to Craig â€˜nâ€™ Dave while playing GTA V, the email congratulating me on making it through to elite landed in my inbox. I had to re-read the email a few times to make sure that I had indeed seen it correctly. However, it was trueâ€¦ I had made it through to the elite phase for a second time.</p>

<p>The locations for this year of Elite depended on what SANS course your preference was. SEC504 and FOR500. As I had found this new interest in computer forensics, I wanted to participate in FOR500, which happened to be in London which was convenient for me.</p>

<p>The start of the week&rsquo;s course was a Monday morning, travelling into London at rush hour was something me and my dad wanted to avoid at all costs. The result of this was a nightâ€™s stay in a hotel in Farringdon the night before. This gave us some time to explore a bit more of London and have nosy around the top of the Walkie-Talkie.</p>

<p>The Monday morning rolled around, and I was nervous about the week ahead, spending a week with people who I had only really spoken to online a hand full of times, Iâ€™m not especial active (If at all) in the community discord server. Once all signed in and chatting with people it was amazing, and the week ahead had started!</p>

<p>For the course, we had the amazing Kevin Ripa as our instructor, who made the course even more exciting. Huge amounts of valuable information were shared with us about digital forensics and computing in general. Seeing how some of the features that make Windows more user friendly could be used to put together a picture of what the user did on the machine was fascinating. I donâ€™t think I can do the course justice here, but I learnt so much from this itâ€™s invaluable.</p>

<p>On the last day, we had the opportunity to take on a real-world example of a case to solve, Katy Stacks for those who know ðŸ˜‰. The task of working out what had happened and then trying to explain why what had happened, happened. It was challenging but then it wouldnâ€™t be a challenge if it was easy.</p>

<p>Another truly amazing part of the course was that we were all given a Forensic Computer Write-Blocker; this prevents any connected drive from having data written to (Essential in an investigation). I have a pile of old IDE and SATA drives I now intend on going through to see what was on them, and just to try forensicating.</p>

<p>This week was invaluable for what I want to do going forward. Not only was this week great for this course, but it was also amazing to meet the others who had made it there. I plan on trying to do some more research into the area and play around with old drives to see what I can pull.</p>

<p>Thanks to all those involved; But I suppose I better start getting ready to take the GCFE exam before moving to university. <a href="https://joincyberdiscovery.com/">If you are interested in trying out CyberDiscovery or just want to find out more, the link to the site can be found here!</a></p>
