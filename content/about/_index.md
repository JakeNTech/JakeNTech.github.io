Why hello there &#128075; I'm Jake, a Forensic computing and security student at Bournemouth University.

I've been interested in computing since 2008, we didn't even have an internet connection at home, that was reserved for a trip to the local library if you wanted to Google something; Which meant we ended up playing a tonne of 90's PC games bought from charity shops and CeX. 

Eventually, we got broadband at home; My YouTube consumption was huge, anyone else remembers ADFS movies or The Annoying Orange?  We also played a tonne of DS games, the number of hours I have in My Sims agents will amaze you.

I started to mess around with programming Python, HTML (not going to have that argument) and Java. [I have all the code I started messing about with here on GitHub](https://github.com/JakeNTech/GCSE-Python-Code), it's from a long time ago so take it easy on me &#128513;

A few years later, having just started at sixth form we were told about an EPQ in CyberSecurity, I thought it sounded interesting and thought I’d give it ago. Some more time later and I’ve taken part in Cyber Discovery for the length of its four-year program and now studying Forensic Computing at university. I’m also lucky enough to hold two GIAC’s, as part of Cyber Discovery.

Messing around with old Hard Drives is something I do a fair bit, my Windows 8.1 VM isn’t too happy with the amount of up-time it has now. I dabble with Hack The Box now and again but it’s fair to say I ain’t that good at it. My interests are definitely down on the forensics side of it all.

Oh, and if it’s not obvious by now I can’t spell. Grammarly usage is strong with this one!
