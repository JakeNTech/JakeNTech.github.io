Hiya! &#128075; I'm Jake, a final-year Forensic Computing and Security student at Bournemouth University. 

All this computer stuff started before we even got an internet connection at home (We had dial-up but were never allowed to use it). I ended up playing a tonne of 90's PC games bought from charity shops. Creating “barrel world” in the Legoland PC game? Just me…okay &#128513;

I started to mess around with Python and Java after starting at Upper school (It’s like secondary school but not for as long). [I have all the python code I made while learning on GitHub](https://github.com/JakeNTech/GCSE-Python-Code), it's probably a mistake to put it on GitHub but it makes for a convenient backup at the very least. &#128541;

Things took another turn when one of our computing teachers told us about a CyberEPQ in the first few weeks of sixth form. It sounded interesting and thought I’d give it ago. To say it was fascinating would be an understatement. Through this EPQ I found Cyber Discovery and things took off from there; being a part of the program for its four-year duration and gaining two GIACs in the process (GCFE and GCIA).

Poking old hard drives is also very good fun, my Windows 8.1 VM is not too happy with the amount of up-time it has now. I once lost a couple of weeks’ worth of free time trying to get an AI to predict network activity levels, “SUCH FUN!” – Penny, Miranda 2009.

Correct spellings are a bit of a rarity around here too; The Grammarly usage is strong with this one!
