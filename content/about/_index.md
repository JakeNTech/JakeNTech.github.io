My interest in computing started before we got an internet connection at home, although we had dial-up we were never allowed to use it. I ended up playing a tonne of 90's PC games bought from charity shops. Creating “barrel world” in the Legoland PC game? Just me…okay &#128513; I also loved the My Sims games on the Nintendo DS/Wii, am very sad they aren't on the Switch!

I started to mess around with Python and Java after starting at upper school. I have the majority of the Python code from GCSE Computing on [GitHub](https://github.com/JakeNTech/GCSE-Python-Code), it's probably a mistake to put it on there but it makes for a convenient backup at the very least. &#128541;

Things took an even more interesting turn when a computer science teacher told us about a Cyber Security EPQ back in the first few weeks of sixth form. It sounded interesting so I said I'd give it ago. To say it was fascinating would be an understatement. My final research piece was a first-hand look into WannaCry, I still have the hard drive with it installed somewhere at home.

Through this EPQ I discovered Cyber Discovery and things took off from there; partaking in the program for its four-year duration; Being invited to attend CyberStart Elite in 2018, 2019 and 2020. The final two years of Elite entailed SANS Courses, I was lucky enough to be invited to take FOR500 and SEC503 gaining the GIAC certs for both, GCFE and GCIA.

For a bit of fun, and a challenge, I poke around with old hard drives to see what they had on them before they were formatted, along with other random projects for things that seem cool to experiment with. I once lost a couple of weeks’ worth of free time trying to get an AI to predict future network activity levels. Some of these projects even get [blog posts!](https://jakentech.com/blog) However most just end up on GitHub.

Outside of computing I enjoy traveling, binge watching TV series, playing Forza, reading and cooking; Well I say cooking but it tends to end up being a huge mess with one burnt object and another underdone food item on a plate. In this process every Gordon Ramsey meme under the sun gets sent to friends with the occasional free test of the smoke alarm.

Currently, I'm a final year student at Bournemouth university studying Forensic Computing and Security looking to move into the industry.
