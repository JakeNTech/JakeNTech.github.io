Before we got an internet connection at home I played some rather niche PC and DS games. I cannot tell you how sad I am that the my Sims games aren't on the Nintendo Switch!

I started to mess around with Python and Java after starting at upper school. I have the majority of the Python code from GCSE Computing on [GitHub](https://github.com/JakeNTech/GCSE-Python-Code), it's probably a mistake to put it on there but it makes for a convenient backup at the very least. &#128541;

Things took a turn when a computing teacher told us about a Cyber Security EPQ. It sounded interesting so I said I'd give it ago. To say it was fascinating would be an understatement. My final research piece was a first-hand look into WannaCry, I still have the hard drive with it installed somewhere at home.

Through this EPQ I discovered Cyber Discovery and wow that was amazing; partaking in the program for its four-year duration. Being invited to attend CyberStart Elite in 2018, 2019 and 2020. With the final two years of Elite entailed SANS Courses, I got the chance to take FOR500 and SEC503 gaining the certs for both (GCFE, GCIA). Now I'm in my final year of a Forensic computing and Security degree at Bournemouth university.

For a bit of fun, and a challenge, I poke around with old hard drives to see what they had/have on them, along with other random projects for things that seem cool to experiment with. I once lost a couple of weeks’ worth of free time trying to get an AI to predict future network activity levels and temperatures. Some of these projects even get [blog posts!](https://jakentech.com/blog) However, most just end up being abandoned GitHub projects.

I do alot of travelling to look at random places (I really need to go and visit Lyne again!), not enough cooking (Well I say cooking but it tends to end up being a huge mess with one burnt object and another underdone food item on a plate. During this process, every Gordon Ramsey meme gets put through paint.net) and playing Forza Horizon.
